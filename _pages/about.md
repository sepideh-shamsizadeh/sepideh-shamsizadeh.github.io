I'm Sepideh, the architect of code and dreams. Freshly minted with a Master's in Computer Engineeringâ€”AI and Robotics majorâ€”from the vibrant University of Padova. But wait, the adventure started way before that! Picture this: me, in the trenches of a startup, a mad scientist concocting R&D magic in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

Now, let's talk love affairsâ€”I've got a thing for the dance of algorithms, the allure of Reinforcement Learning, the spectacle of Computer Vision, and the grand symphony of Robotics. Oh, and did I mention, my heart beats in mathematical beats?

For me, problems are puzzles begging to be solved, and challenges are the spice of life. Give me a tough nut to crack, and watch me turn it into code poetry. Victory never tasted so sweet.

But here's the big dreamâ€”I'm on a mission to craft robots that don't just exist; they live! They'll be the superheroes of tomorrow, Earth's saviors in metal and circuits.

So, buckle up! Join me in the whirlwind of AI escapades, where each line of code is a stroke of genius, and every innovation brings us a step closer to a future where robots and humans coexist in perfect harmony.

This is not just a website; it's an invitation to join the coolest tech party in town. Ready for the adventure? Let's dive in! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¤–âœ¨
