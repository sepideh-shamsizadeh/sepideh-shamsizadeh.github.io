Get ready to explore the world of 3D segmentation as we take a journey through PointNet, a super cool way to understand 3D shapes. PointNet is like a smart tool for computers to look at 3D things, especially groups of points floating in space. It’s different from other methods because it works directly with these points, without forcing them into grids or pictures.

In this article, we’re going to make PointNet easy to understand. We’ll go from the big ideas to actually writing code in Python and PyTorch to do 3D segmentation. But before we jump into the fun part, let’s first get what PointNet is all about — how it became a big deal for figuring out 3D stuff like objects and their parts.[Continue Reading](https://medium.com/@sepideh.92sh/decoding-pointnet-a-practical-guide-to-3d-segmentation-with-python-and-pytorch-7a037fecb8a7)
